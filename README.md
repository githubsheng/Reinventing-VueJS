# Reinventing VueJS

Many books and blogs teach you how to use VueJS, this series of articles and code samples teach you how to make a VueJS. 

We will start by building something very simple, and gradually add more and more features, so eventually it can replace the real VueJS library in some simple use cases. 

In each chapter, we will be discussing how to implement a particular feature, or how to optimize performance. The sample code of each chapter is stand alone and is ready to run.

The following is an index of topics we are going to cover:

# How to read this series

Every branch represents a chapter. The README.md of the chapter contains all the text and explanations, and the code in the the branch contains everything we have built so far (until the chapter)
